# Visited Countries Application

## About the project

An application that enables the user to save countries to a list of countries they have visited
and include their favourite photos of each country, so they can return
and view them whenever they want. The user can add one country
multiple times. Also, the user is allowed to rate the countries they save 
at a rating from 1 to 10. Additionally, users are able to write about their 
experience in each country. This application is designed for individuals 
who enjoy traveling and like to keep memories from countries they visit. 

I am personally interested in this project because traveling and the experience
that I get from visiting different countries is what I enjoy the
most . Also, I want to have my own application that I can use to keep 
track of countries I visit.

**Improvements:**
If I would improve the design of the project, I would add a message printer 
class that will be responsible for error and warning messages because there
are a lot of messages, and they all share similar properties. Also, JsonWriter and 
JsonReader could have implemented singleton pattern because there is always only one 
object of both of them.
